## Story
You are a young woman who is on the run. You possess power no one has seen before, and although you do not understand it, you are able to shoot energy blasts from your hand. Escape your pursuers through any means necessary. However, be warned... your actions have consequences.  
  
## Mechanics
Jump your way through the levels while avoiding enemies. Killing them affects your morality, with three possible endings: good, bad, and neutral. Evil players are punished with tougher opponents, whereas good players are challenged with tougher puzzles (how do I finish this level without killing anyone?).
